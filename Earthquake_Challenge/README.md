# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background

The basis of this assignment was to present earthquake data as a dynamic map, highlighting earthquakes in relation to tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.


## Overview

We have been tasked with completing three technical analysis deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map


## Resources

- Data source: GeoJSON data

- Software: HTML, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, CSS, Visual Studio Code

## Results

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- We successfully added tectonic plate data which is displayed as pink overlay on the map (see image below).

Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- We successfully added major earthquake data which appears as an overlay with circles in different shades of purple on the map (see image below).

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
- We successfully added a third map style -- Mapbox Navigation Night -- to our earthquake map (see image below).

## Summary
All in all, we successfully created a dynamic earthquake map that has three map styles, displays two earthquake data sets as well as tectonic plate data.
